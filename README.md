## How we used generative AI

The image is generated by Bing using this prompt:

> Rick Astley in the never going to give you up video vacationing in the city of arts and science in Valencia


The HTML code is generated by ChatGPT 3 using the next prompt:


> Code me a website that has a header that says "HELLO VALENCIA CODES" We want the website to look professional. We want the website to have a big logo in the middle that is an image named logo.jpeg. We also want there to be a countdown in big black letters superimposed on the logo image that has a countdown from ten to zero. This countdown must be visible. When it gets to zero, the image component must be changed for a youtube video with the url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Z7zEc7AXQ. Also the video must be centered, start to play and the countdown disappears
